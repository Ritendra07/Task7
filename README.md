# 🧠 Support Vector Machines (SVM) - Binary Classification

This project demonstrates the use of Support Vector Machines (SVM) for linear and non-linear classification using the **Breast Cancer Wisconsin** dataset. It includes data preparation, model training with different kernels, decision boundary visualization, and hyperparameter tuning with cross-validation.

## 📌 Objective

- Apply SVM for binary classification
- Visualize decision boundaries in 2D
- Compare linear and RBF kernels
- Tune hyperparameters (`C`, `gamma`)
- Evaluate performance using cross-validation
